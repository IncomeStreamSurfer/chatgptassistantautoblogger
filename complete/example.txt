**What is a B2B Startup?**
--------------------------

A B2B startup is a business-to-business startup that provides products or services to other businesses rather than to individual consumers. In other words, a B2B startup is a company that targets other companies as its primary customer base. B2B startups may provide a wide range of services or products, such as software, marketing services, logistics solutions, or financial services, among others. B2B startups often work with other companies to solve specific problems or address unique needs in the market. They may also offer products or services that help other businesses operate more efficiently, save money, or improve their bottom line.

In terms of business model, B2B startups often operate on a subscription or licensing basis, providing ongoing services or access to their technology platforms for a recurring fee. This can provide a stable revenue stream for the company and help build long-term relationships with their clients.
