## How to autoblog using the ChatGPT Assistant's API Service Page Generator

First generate a content plan using my topical authority generator:

https://chat.openai.com/g/g-Gk8veittn-service-page-topical-authority-seo-generator

Then, take the outline that it gives you at the end and save it to a file called

content_plan.csv

Then, you need some brand images, currently the best way I have of doing this is:

Get this plug-in:

https://wordpress.org/plugins/xml-sitemap-generator-for-google/

Create an image-sitemap

Copy and paste the image sitemap into a notepad

Save it as brandimagesandlinks.txt

Then, finally, get a service page you've already created and that is ranking on Google, and copy and paste it, then paste it to clipboardtomarkdown/pastetomarkdown (search that on google - it's a github)
